In this research project, we sought out to find a machine learning classifier which could be used to determine tumor malignancy. The goal was to identify the best suited machine learning classifier to classify a tumor as malignant or benign based on phenotypic data from breast tumor samples. Given the importance of diagnosis of malignant tumors, we defined that False Negatives to be worse than False Positives, and consequently, we selected recall as the main performance metric. For our project, we evaluated the performance of five different supervised Machine Learning Classifiers, including: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor and Linear Discriminant Analysis.

About the data:
The data used to test classifiers is the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) data set, 
originally collected from researchers at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. 
The data set contains information gathered from fine needle aspiratesâ€™ digitized images of breast tumors. 
Fine needle aspirate is a type of biopsy which allows for the collection of cells from a cell mass. 
The data set contains 569 breast tumor samples of which 212 are malignant and 357 are benign. In addition to the classification, the data contains ten real-valued features for each cell nucleus: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
